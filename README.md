##DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1 :
FOR THIS TASK, I WAS ASSIGNED TO CREATE AND CONFIGURE A CLOUD STORAGE SOLUTION USING EITHER AMAZON WEB SERVICES (AWS) S3 OR GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE (GCS). I CHOSE TO USE  AWS S3 TO COMPLETE THE TASK. THIS TASK WAS MY FIRST STEP INTO HANDS-ON CLOUD COMPUTING, AND IT GAVE ME A PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CLOUD STORAGE WORKS, HOW TO MANAGE FILES IN THE CLOUD, AND HOW TO CONFIGURE ACCESS PERMISSIONS SECURELY.

I STARTED BY LOGGING INTO MY CLOUD ACCOUNT AND NAVIGATING TO THE STORAGE SERVICE SECTION. I THEN CREATED A NEW BUCKET WHICH SERVES AS A STORAGE CONTAINER FOR OBJECTS (FILES). WHILE CREATING THE BUCKET, I MADE SURE TO SELECT A UNIQUE BUCKET NAME (AS BUCKET NAMES MUST BE GLOBALLY UNIQUE), CHOSE THE REGION CLOSEST TO ME FOR BETTER LATENCY, AND OPTED FOR STANDARD STORAGE CLASS TO ENSURE HIGH AVAILABILITY AND LOW LATENCY.

AFTER THE BUCKET WAS SUCCESSFULLY CREATED, I MOVED TO THE NEXT STEP – UPLOADING EXAMPLE FILES. I UPLOADED A FEW SAMPLE FILES . THESE FILES WERE CHOSEN TO SHOWCASE THE ABILITY TO STORE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FILES IN THE CLOUD. I USED THE PLATFORM’S WEB INTERFACE TO EASILY UPLOAD THESE FILES, WHICH HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THE FILE STRUCTURE AND HOW OBJECTS ARE HANDLED IN THE BUCKET.

THE NEXT IMPORTANT STEP WAS CONFIGURING ACCESS PERMISSIONS. THIS INVOLVED SETTING UP WHO CAN VIEW OR DOWNLOAD THE FILES I UPLOADED. INITIALLY, THE BUCKET AND ITS OBJECTS WERE SET TO PRIVATE, MEANING ONLY AUTHORIZED USERS (LIKE ME) COULD ACCESS THEM. I TESTED OUT MAKING SOME FILES PUBLIC BY EDITING THEIR PERMISSIONS AND ENABLING “PUBLIC READ ACCESS.” THIS ALLOWED ANYONE WITH THE LINK TO ACCESS THE FILE, WHICH IS VERY COMMON WHEN HOSTING IMAGES, DOCUMENTS, OR STATIC FILES ONLINE.

I ALSO EXPLORED BUCKET POLICY OPTIONS AND UNDERSTOOD HOW TO WRITE POLICIES IN JSON FORMAT TO CONTROL ACCESS AT A BROADER LEVEL. THIS GAVE ME INSIGHT INTO CLOUD SECURITY PRACTICES, A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN ANY CLOUD SETUP.

TO DOCUMENT MY WORK, I TOOK MULTIPLE SCREENSHOTS INCLUDING:

THE BUCKET CREATION SCREEN

THE FILE UPLOAD SECTION

THE PERMISSION SETTINGS PANEL

A PUBLIC FILE OPENED THROUGH ITS URL

I CREATED GITHUB REPOSITORY(NAMED: CLOUD STORAGE SETUP) AND UPLOADED ALL THE SCREENSHOTS, A SAMPLE FILE, AND A README.MD FILE CONTAINING A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE TASK, BUCKET NAME, PLATFORM USED, FILE LINKS, AND STEPS FOLLOWED.

THIS TASK TAUGHT ME HOW CLOUD STORAGE WORKS IN REAL-LIFE SCENARIOS. IT MADE ME COMFORTABLE WITH NAVIGATING CLOUD PLATFORMS, MANAGING STORAGE BUCKETS, AND THINKING ABOUT ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY. OVERALL, IT WAS A VERY INSIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE THAT BUILT A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR MORE ADVANCED CLOUD TASKS IN THE FUTURE.
